# Mashtaly Sensor (Soil moisture sensor using IoT)

**Sensor Utilization in Mashtaly**

In Mashtaly, a soil moisture sensor serves as a pivotal component for monitoring plant water requirements. This sensor measures soil moisture levels and communicates the data to the application via Wi-Fi connectivity. The collected information is then utilized to notify users about their plants' watering needs and suggest appropriate watering amounts, enhancing water conservation efforts.

**ESP8266 Microcontroller Chip:**

ESP8266 is a cost-effective microcontroller chip with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, tailored for IoT applications. Developed by Espressif Systems in 2014, it has since become a widely adopted solution in various projects, ranging from basic home automation to sophisticated applications. Notably, the ESP8266 integrates seamlessly with soil moisture sensors, facilitating their incorporation into agricultural, horticultural, and gardening projects to ensure optimal plant hydration for growth and vitality.
